1.	Prepare SD card with Debian OS
   * Download the latest version of the Raspbian OS from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/.
   * Install to your computer (might be different for MacOS or Linux OS)
      * PuTTY (for remote access to RasPi via ssh)
      * WinSCP (transfer data over ssh)
      * BalenaEtcher (flash OS to SD)
   * Flash OS to SD card (min 8 GB, 16 recommended, > class 6, format beforehand with “sd memory card formatter”)
   * Add File named “ssh” without file name extensions to root (named “boot”) sd card folder to enable ssh on startup.
   * If Wifi: add one file to boot folder of SD card:
      * File named “wpa_supplicant.conf” with the following code:

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=de
network={
    ssid="name of your wireless network"
    psk="password of your wireless network"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}

   * If ethernet:
      * Connect RasPi to a monitor via HDMI, boot and get ip address from home screen.
2.  Access RasPi remotely and prepare it for operation
   * Connect to the raspberry pi with PuTTY over ssh:
      * Ip:
         * if wifi: enter same ip as in wpa_supplicant.conf
         * if ethernet: enter ip written down from RasPi's home screen.
      * Port: 22	
   * Update software: (either with command line editor from RasPi's desktop or by using ssh.)
      * > sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
   * change password: 
      * > passwd: 
   * shutdown:
      * > sudo shutdown -h now
      * > sudo halt

2.	Wire components
   * Raspberry 3 B pinouts and explanation (https://de.pinout.xyz/)
   * Motor driver: 
      * End switch:
         * red wire - VCC (RAMPS +) power
         * black wire - GND (RAMPS -) ground
         * green wire - SIGNAL (RAMPS S) signal
